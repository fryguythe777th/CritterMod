critter mod adds 5 unique and quirky critters to the game
the critters:
1. blood glop - spawns in the crimson
2. pipspook - spawns in graveyards
3. pot mimic - spawns nearly anywhere underground
4. shrimp - spawns in the ocean
5. shrumeling - spawns in the mushroom biome

each critter has a silly way for the player to interact with it in some way
i will be working on adding more critters
if you really hate any critter in particular you can disable them in mod config
